            <ul class="fact-list">
              <li class="fact anim-typewriter4">Try to write informative prompts, describe how you got the injury, how does the injury feel( itching, hot, etc ) and such. though dont write too much. </li>
              <li class="fact anim-typewriter3">Try to center the injury in the middle of the camera ( The + in the middle of the live camera view. ) for best results.</li>
              <li class="fact anim-typewriter2">Try to be as accurate as you can when it comes to the pain level. ( The description of the pain level does not need to exactly describe how painful the injury is. )</li>
              <li class="fact anim-typewriter4">The selections under the 'ANALISIS' button should describe how much available resources you have at you place. ( It does not have to be accurate. )</li>
              <li class="fact anim-typewriter1">The body part selection is meant to help the output be more accurate, try to select the area that fits the best.</li>
              <li class="fact anim-typewriter3">Soon we will add more features and make ANALISIS more accurate, and overall better (Including UI Changes, Model Changes, etc..).</li>
